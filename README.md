# Chung Bae Team - Garuda Hackathon

## Our idea
_Last summer, I was spending time at my village. My aunt asked me to visit the local markets for bringing out household appliances. That's exactly where this idea of connecting those local markets to customers came from. With this changing environment, I would like to add efforts in achieving the goals of sustainability and making the products affordable._

The web app, Helperhand, aims to establish a relationship between small business owners in villages to customers without a middleman. The products from local markets are environment-friendly, affordable and sustainable. The present scenario clearly depicts the clueless and helpless behaviour of everyone. Undoubtedly, there’s going to be more outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. That’s not a maybe; that’s a given. It’s the result of the way that we, as human beings, are interacting with our planet. This fear can be a very powerful tool for forcing all of us to accept the immediate and necessary measures for the "common good". 

We can't think of a better way to protect ourselves than helping in boosting ourselves to think of better ways of sustainability. The products should be upgraded so as to get processed in the industry keeping in mind the factors of sustainability. Together, we can make this world a better place to live in. 

The products need to be affordable to the common people. Without a middleman being involved, the products would obviously be cheaper. Small business owners will be having full control over their products' pricing. As a result, there will be higher profit margin for them. Potentially cheaper prices for customers will be available. 

## What it does

Lack of access to technology, poor education, lack of skills of training inhibits the growth of local markets. The app, Helperhand, allows some motivated individuals to be representatives from nearby local areas. Those persons will be in contact with small business owners who may not have access to the internet. Small business owners will be able to deploy their products into our website with the help of the representatives. Customers from all around Indonesia will be able to purchase products from here.

## How I built it

We created the web application in [bubble.io] (https://helperhand.bubbleapps.io/version-test?debug_mode=true) and have used [Balsamiq] (https://balsamiq.com/) for creating wireframes.

## Challenges I ran into

Using bubble was quite challenging for us as we started contributing to the idea very lately and so we were left with less time. The team members belong to different regions which have huge time-differences and it was quite difficult to manage tasks. More than half of us had exams to focus on and taking out time for the hackathon was too precious.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Learning and handling the tasks throughout gave a lot of pleasure to us. The very idea of helping people and also contributing to the growth of local markets is an insightful accomplishment in itself. We are so happy to be a part of this.
 
## What I learned

Every product, brand or whatsoever starts from an idea. Then it goes from prototyping to it's real usage by everyone out there. It takes a lot of skills and patience to work things together.

## What's next for Helperhand

We want to raise our standards and limits of the app not only in Indonesia but throughout the world.
_Thankyou so much for such an exciting opportunity :)_
